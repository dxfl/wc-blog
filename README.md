## knearest.rb


This is code for playing with the *k*-nearest neighbors (*k*-NN) classifier.

It has 2 classifiers, 2 *k*-nn methods, the weightedknn and the knnestimate, this one without weights, meaning that each point of the *k* set contributes the same to the estimation.

Original code from the Toby Segaran great book [Programming Collective Intelligence](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do), but instead of Python I'm using Ruby, I love Ruby.
